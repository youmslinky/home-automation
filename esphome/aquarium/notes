lambdas in esphome speak are just c++ code.
you can get values from esphome world by using id(<yaml_var>)
such as from a binary sensor: id(binary_sensor_id).state

TODO put ip address on screen:
https://esphome.io/components/text_sensor/wifi_info.html
need to set it as internal component if I don't want it to show up in home assistant


looks like the display loop only runs every time sensors update, so in the case of aquarium.yaml as of now, 5s.
